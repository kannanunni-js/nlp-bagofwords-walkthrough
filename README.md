🧠 **NLP Essentials | Part 3: Unpacking the Bag of Words Model – A Foundational Approach to Text Similarity**

While NLP models have evolved, the Bag of Words (BoW) technique is still a cornerstone for text representation and similarity. Here’s a quick breakdown of what it is, how it works, and what its limitations are.

📘 **What is Bag of Words?**

BoW transforms documents into vectors of word counts—ignoring grammar, word order, and context. It’s a classic approach behind many text similarity tasks (like spam detection).

⚙️ **Workflow**:

- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean text, remove stopwords, etc.
- **Vocabulary Construction**: Collect all unique words from your dataset.
- **Vector Representation**: Represent each document by word presence or frequency.

🔧 **BoW Extensions**:

- **Binary BoW**: Marks word presence (1 or 0)
- **Count-based BoW**: Tracks word frequency

⚠️ **Key Challenges**:

- **Curse of Dimensionality**: Large vocab = sparse, high-dimensional data
- **No Word Importance**: All words treated equally; no sense of relevance
- **No Semantic Similarity**: “Cat” and “dog” are as unrelated as “cat” and “anvil”
- **Variable Document Length**: Needs padding or sparse structures

🛠️ **Implementation Paths**:

- **Learning**: Python `dict`s + sparse arrays — great to understand the fundamentals
- **Production**: `CountVectorizer` from `sklearn` uses fast, optimized SciPy sparse matrices

💡 **Did you know?**

When using `CountVectorizer` from `scikit-learn`, the result isn’t just a plain list or array — it’s actually a SciPy sparse matrix (`csr_matrix`) under the hood. This design choice is intentional and powerful: it allows the model to efficiently store only the non-zero word counts, making it highly memory-efficient for large vocabularies. Perfect for scaling NLP tasks in production!

✅ **Takeaway**:  
Bag of Words is simple, but essential for mastering more powerful NLP techniques. Dive into hands-on examples and step-by-step logic to build your foundation!



## 🚢 Docker Setup

You can containerize and run the File Score Calculator using Docker:

### 🛠 Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t bagofwords .
```

docker run -p 8000:8000 bagofwords
```



## 🧰 Installation and Setup (Development)

### Backend

1. Navigate to the project root (or backend directory if separated):
   ```bash
   cd ./nlp-bagofwords-walkthrough
   ```

2. Sync and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run the backend application:
